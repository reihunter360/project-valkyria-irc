======================================================
Battlefields are where the players face the monsters.
The battlefields themselves control the weather and
may have events that occasionally happen. There
can be more than one event set per battlefield. 

Please look at the pre-existing events for 
how to set it all up.

Valid Targets: all, random, monsters, players
 * note that "players" as a target also affects NPCs

Valid Event Types: damage, heal, statusonly
