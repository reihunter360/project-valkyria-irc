2Welcome.  No doubt by now you've seen a battle or two and may be wondering what's going on. 
2You are watching a new IRC game created by James ("Iyouboushi").  This game is basically an automated battle simulator that you can take part in that is loosely based on a mix of Harmony of Despair with the Devil May Cry series (and other anime, games and stories mixed in for flavor).
2The concept of this bot is to be fully automated, with no DMs/GMs/bot owners to be involved.
2Your mission is to create a character and fight off demons from various anime, games and stories. As you defeat enemies you will gain orbs of experience that you can use to upgrade your weapons and stats so that you can better survive the onslaught of the minions and their leaders.
