12::[FinalGetsuga]::
2Final Getsuga is a special type of boost that will give your character immense power for the duration of the battle.  However, the catch is that at the end of battle your character will basically be reset to a level 1.It's basically a giant reset button.  There are a few things that you'll get to keep though: Items, 5% of the total orbs spent, levels in your Fists weapon and DoublePunch technique.  Everything else you will lose (so all black orbs, weapons, skills, the rest of the techniques, etc). Stats, of course, reset to 5 each with 100 hp/20 tp.
