As with any program ever made, there's always going to be bugs.  These are the KNOWN bugs that you shouldn't email me about at the moment:

* Too Many Commands Crash
There's going to be an occasional instance where if too many people are doing too many commands at once (i.e. multiple people using the shop while a battle is going on) that may cause the bot to crash.  I think this is probably a problem in mIRC and there's not much I can do about it.

* AoEs Used On Too Many Monsters Flood
Due to how the AOEs work in this bot, if they're used on a huge amount of monsters it will cause the bot to start spitting out tons of text to the server.  In most instances, the IRC server will have flood protection and kill the bot for flooding.  The solution is to not have too many players and monsters in battle at once.

* Bot Isn't Working In This Particular Folder!
The bot doesn't work in any folder that has spaces in the name of it.  For example, running the bot \Program Files\ will cause several problems.  Same goes if you tried to run it in \Battle Arena\.   The solution, of course, is to just make sure that none of the folders has spaces in them.  My suggestion is to run the bot in C:\BattleArena\   but you can always create a folder like  C:\IRC\Bots\BattleArena and run it from there.  It doesn't really matter as long as none of the folders have spaces.

* Lagging Giving Multiple Errors
If the bot lags and the person keeps using the same command over and over it could potentially break the bot.  For example, using attack on a monster more than once.  Although it shouldn't happen, sometimes the lag will cause it to process the command a bunch of times in a row.  The only thing I can think of to fix this error is to find a way to not lag and make your players slow down if you are lagging.

* Monsters Attacking Themselves
This seems to be rather rare but occasionally monsters will just randomly decide they hate themselves.  I haven't found the source of this bug yet. If it happens you can have a bot owner use !next or just wait til the automatic next timer kicks in to get past it.  Will be investigating this more in the future so that it hopefully will be fixed.
