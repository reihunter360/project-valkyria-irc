PORTAL BATTLES
Portal Battles are special battles that can only be accessed by first obtaining a special item (usually obtained by trading BeastmenSeal and KindredSeals) and then using that item in battle.  When used, the battlefield will be cleared of all monsters and all players will be teleported to a special battlefield to fight one or more special bosses.

This text file is meant to give more information on all the various battles that can be encountered.

GEMOFTHENORTH
Reports are coming in from all over the world of a mysterious...flying....city!?  What?!  It seems that ancient legends about gods living in a city above the clouds are true!  From what we can gather, there's five large chambers that make up the city; four at each point of a compass and one in the center.  The one in the center seems to be surrounded by some protective magical energy that our forces cannot even begin to penetrate.  The others are only protected with weak charms, and we're working on it one at a time.

So far we've managed to survey the north chamber. It seems to be home to Genbu.  Shami has made an item that can teleport heroes up there to its chamber.  Be sure to go check it out but beware.  The ancient texts say the ancient sky gods were powerful beings.

IGNISFATUUS
Reports of a giant flying whale-looking demon have been coming in.  Allegedly it's already eaten an entire school bus.  God help those that were inside it at the time.  The Allied Intelligence has gathered that the beast is just simply too big and too strongly armored to take on first-hand.  In order to defeat this thing, it's going to have to be done from the inside.  Yeah, the inside. You'll need to reach the heart chamber of the beast and defeat its beating heart to take it down..  Shami might know of a way.

Perhaps the strange merchant Shami knows of a way inside and would be willing to trade or sell an item to help.

It seems this body has created a shell made out of dead bodies for protection and is trying to summon an undead army of zombies.  This creature must be stopped at all cost!  Shami is willing to trade an item that will teleport you into the dungeon itself.  But beware!  Reports have indicated that the creature can devour the minions it is summoning to become stronger.
