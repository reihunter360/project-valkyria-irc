- Added the ability to purchase multiple items from the shop with one command. To do so, just add an amount at the end of the
  command (example:  !shop buy items name #  where # is the amount you want with one purchase.) It doesn't work with styles

1.3
- Added the "translation.dat" file that contains most of the bot messages.  You can edit this file to do translations or
  to just change the way various messages read. Open it in notepad.
- Added the active skill "Analysis".  This skill lets you analyze a monster.  Increased levels of the skill gives you more
  information about the monster.  To use it, after purchasing it, use !analyze monstername  You can only analyze monsters
  that are in the current battle.

- Added the passive skill "Zen" -- this skill will increase the amount of TP you get back per turn by 5*skill level.
- Added the passive skill "Haggling" -- This skill will increase the amount of orbs you get for selling items by 20*skill level
  EXCEPT in cases where the amount you'd get from haggling is more than the actual cost of the item (i.e. a potion).  
  In that case you just get the original item price back, or up to 500 orbs back if it goes over 500.
- Added the passive skill "WeaponBash" -- This skill will give a chance of inflicting the 'stun' status effect to a target
  with each melee hit. Note, if the target is immune to stun it will never take effect.
- Added a new item type: ShopReset. This item type will allow you to lower your current shop level by an amount. The
  "DiscountCard" has been added as an example item. 250,000 orbs and will lower it by 10 points.
- Added a new item type: Revive with a GoldOrb as an example item.  If you use the item on someone (or yourself) in battle
  they will receive the "revive" status.  If that person dies in the same battle, they will be revived automatically 
  with 1/2 max hp.
- Added an anti-cheat system for players using monster weapons/techniques. Attacks/Techs done with monster weapons will be
  0-5 damage max if the person using them isn't a monster or a NPC.
- Added the ability for techs to change which base stat is used for damage. You can add a stat= with the stat you want
  to use in the tech file.  For example:  stat=str  or stat=spd     By default it's int.
- Added the Heal-AOE type. This type will heal all allies on the battlefield. This tech type can't be used on enemies.
- Added the ability to sell items back to the shop. Use !shop sell item (item name) (amount) to sell them back.
- Added the ability for monsters/bosses to be "staggered" -- if they sustain enough damage they'll collapse and will 
  be unable to move for a round.  They can only be staggered once per battle. In the [info] section of a monster/boss you can
  add CanStagger=yes  then add StaggerAmount=$rand(#,#)   where # is the amount of hp you want the range to be. Stagger will
  activate when damage exceeds the random amount picked from the range.
- Added the Quicksilver style. This still allows players to use the !quicksilver command that will freeze everyone except the
  user in time. Players can use the !quicksilver command in battle as many times as style's level. The effect basically gives
  players a free Sugitekai.
- Added the ability for monsters to ignore the darkness/rage mode system.  In [info] you can put RageMode=ignore  if you 
  want them to not get the darkness/rage mode bonus. 
- Added the ability for monsters to be able to absorb certain elements from techniques.  In the [Element] section of the 
  monster bot owners can put Heal= followed by the elements it'll heal with.  For example:  Heal=Fire.Dark

  Note that if a battle is currently in progress it won't take effect until the battle is over.

  from automatically taking effect. 
- Added the ability for monsters to use certain select skills in battle.
- Added accessories to the bot! Once you get one you can use !wear (accessory name) to put it on and 
  !remove (accessory name) if you want to remove it.
- Added two AI types for monsters. They are: Defender and Berserker.  Defender type monsters won't attack at all during 
  battle and Berserker type monsters may attack their own allies at random. You can change it  in [info] ai_type=         
  Leave it blank if you want monsters to act as normal.
- Added the beginning of an achievement system.
- Added the max shop level in the system.dat.  Bot owners can now change it to whatever they want. By default it's 25.
- Added a new boss type fight: Doppelganger.  It's a rare, 5% chance, event that instead of summoning a normal boss, players
  will have to fight evil copies of themselves. Bot owners can disable it in the system.dat by setting EnableDoppenganger 
  to false.
- Added new monsters
- Added new bosses
- Added new summons
- Added new NPCs
- Changed the way the monster/boss/npc lists are generated to hopefully make them more random and to prevent a future bug.
- Changed the prices of several skills/weapon upgrades/techs/items.
- Changed the max amount of damage of suicide techs that can be done by players to 500.  This should prevent someone with
  hundreds of thousands of hp one-shotting every monster/boss in the game.
- Changed the maximum number of times a target can be successfully stolen from to 2.
- Changed the maximum amount of HP you can buy from the shop. The default is 2500.  After you hit the max you won't be able
  to get any more. Bot owners can change the max in the system.dat.
- Changed the maximum amount of TP you can buy from the shop. The default is 500.  After you hit the max you won't be able
  to get any more. Bot owners can change the max in the system.dat.
- Changed the maximum amount of style points you can accumulate in one battle to 5000.
- Changed the location of the skill cooldown times into the skills.db. Bot Owners can now edit that file to edit skill reuse times
- Changed the way boss drops works so that they can have multiple drops. The bot will still only pick one drop, but now you can
  make it random.
- Changed it so if multiple bosses enter the battle, all of their drops should be in the pool rather than just the
  most recent boss to join.
- Changed the damage formula on poison.  Instead of doing random 5-10 damage a turn (which is nothing when players 
  have HP over 1000), it now does a percentage of a target's max HP.  The "Heavily Poisoned" status does even more than 
  normal poison.
- Changed the next turn timer so that it's only 3 minutes instead of 5.
- Changed the damage formula slightly for 4 hit and 5 hit attacks.
- Changed the code so that boss battles may spawn normal monsters as well when the winning streak is greater than 50.
- Changed the BloodPact skill so that it goes up to level 10. Higher levels of the skill will increase the stats of the summon
  by 25% (plus a random 1-5% at random) each level.
- Changed OrbHunter so that bot owners can place the amount they want the skill to increase orbs by.  In skills.db you can put in
  Amount=  under [OrbHunter].  Default is now 15*skill level.

- Fixed a bug in which the description wasn't being shown properly for +TP items.
- Fixed the bot so that it will correctly give the right access level to the entire bot owner list when the bot is first turned on.
- Fixed a bug in which occasionally the style level wasn't leveling properly.  Sometimes it would jump by +2 or +3, other times
  it would be reset to level 1. 
- Fixed a bug that was letting players purchase monster weapons.
- Fixed a bug in which fleeing would cause the bot to break in a one vs one battle against an orb fountain.
- Fixed a bug in which you could use consumable items with the !use command and the item would be decreased from your inventory.
- Fixed a bug in which MightyStrike could be used continuously without a cooldown.
- Fixed a bug where if something was weak to lightning it would also take double damage for light element as well.
- Fixed a bug with Fullbring when used on +TP items.
- Fixed a bug in which monsters killed by AOEs were giving double the style points that it should have.

  Chests can only be unlocked with the correct colored key. Chests will disappear after 45 seconds. 
- Added a way to save and restore winning streaks. Think of it sort of like a quick save in RPGs. The commands are:
  !save battle streak to save the streak, !reload battle streak  to reload, and !view battle save  to see what's saved.
  Note: You can't save a streak that's lower than your previous save, you can't reload during a positive winning streak, and 
  once you load the current save you have will be reset.
- Added keys. Keys are dropped by monsters randomly after the 15th win on the winning streak. The person who gets the key is
  random, but the person has to be alive at the end of battle to be considered. To use the key just use !use KeyName on Chest

  more time.

- Added new monsters
- Added new bosses
- Changed the way the utsusemi/royalguard/manawall blocked messages are displayed. They're shown after the attack desc now, not
  before it. This actually saves a line being pushed to the channel.
- Changed the way status types are inflicted upon a target. Much cleaner code and now any type of tech or weapon can inflict a 
  status.  Just add a StatusType=(status type) to the weapon/tech.  The Type=Status is now defunct, and it should be set as 
  Single or AOE.
- Changed the way the red orb rewards are listed so that it now shows what each person gets based on his/her skills/accessories
  rather than simply showing just the base amount that everyone gets.

1.5 
- Added a check so that people can only create a certain # of characters max. This only works if the bot can look up 
  IP addresses and people have logged into their characters with this feature on (so that it stores the IPs).  
  The max # of chars allowed is in system.dat and can be changed to the bot owner's liking.
- Added the ability for monsters and clones to change their weapons in the middle of battle before attacking.
  Neither can change to glyphs if they aren't already equipped when the clone/doppelganger is created. Note that regular
  monsters and bosses have a higher rate of changing their weapons vs both types of doppelgangers.
- Added the active skill Provoke -- Will cause a monster you use it on to attack you its next round instead of another target.
- Added the active skill Disarm -- Will attempt to disarm a target back to their base fists. 
- Added the active skill "WeaponLock" -- Will consume Sokubaku to lock a target's weapon in place for a # of turns.
- Added the resistance skill "Resist-Petrify"  -- right now it only goes to 20.  Like other resists, 
  it decreases the chance that petrify will work on you.

  only the Vampire_Killer whip is set to true.

  The max is 10% (level 10 Trickster).
- Added the command !battle hp -- This command can only be used in battle and will display the HP status of all allies. 
- Added the !scoreboard command. This command can only be used when there's 3 or more players in the game. It will rank the
  top 3 players based on a number of factors (including stats, orbs, chests opened, etc).
- Added the !score command. This command will show players their individual scores.
- Added a new flag in system.dat that bot owners can toggle manually.  It's called ShowOrbsCmdInChannel=true/false   
  If true, the !orbs command will display the person's orb total in channel.  If set false, it will send it to the person 
  in a private message. 
- Added a bonus effect to using a weapon that a user has a mastery maxed in: Parrying. If a player's mastery for the 
  weapon equipped is 100 or greater, there's a small chance that the person will parry a melee attack using that weapon.
  Using the style Weapon Master will help the odds of parrying an attack, but a person still needs 100 mastery first.
- Added a notification to the player style leveling up so players know when their style levels.
- Added the ability for multiple waves of monsters. The higher the winning streak, the bigger the chance that there will be
  more than one wave of monsters to arrive. Battles with multiple waves will have a higher max orb reward limit.

  current difficulty level and !save difficulty #  to set it. The # can be 0 or any number greater than 0.

- Changed the code to try and reduce the odds of monsters one-shotting players on turn #1. 
- Changed !stats so that you can now use it on other players to see what their stats are.  It cannot be used on NPCs

  up the other person.
- Changed it so bosses will no longer appear below streak #10.
- Changed /me gives so that you don't HAVE to specify a number if you only want to give 1 of an item.

- Fixed a major security flaw.
- Fixed a bug in which DARK type spells weren't being enhanced by GLOOMY type weather.
- Fixed a bug in which the WIZARDRY passive skill wasn't working right due to a mispelling. There's a temporary fix in the bot
  that will be removed in 1.6. Have one battle end before characters buy any more into the wizardry skill to fix it.
- Fixed a bug with the Aztec-GoldCoin accessory and gave its absorb effect a bit of a boost.
- Fixed a bug in which it was possible to cover a non-existent character, thus causing errors that would freeze the bot.
- Fixed a bug with AOEs being used on players in PVP in which it would hit the user and miss some other players.

2.0
- Added the Augment system. Use the command !augment by itself to see the augments you have equipped. To add augments to a 
  weapon use: !augment add (weapon) (rune)  To remove an augment: !augment remove (weapon)   To see the current strength
  of augments that are in effect, use !augment strength   The strength only shows based on current armor/weapons.
- Added "Runes" to the items list. Runes are used to augment weapons with special effects. Use !runes to see which runes you own.
- Added boss drops to evil doppelgangers and warmachines. The drops will be random based on various items in items.db.
- Added silver chests and silver keys.
- Added purple chests and purple keys.
- Added Renkei (Skillchains). If two techniques that qualify (non-magic) are done to a target, it will activate a renkei that
  will deal additional damage to a target.
- Added a new stat: Ignition Gauge.  You can see your current ignition gauge by using !ig or !ignition gauge.  You can buy it
  in the shop with !buy stats IG #  Unlike hp/tp, buying them won't full the gauge to full. Ignition Gauge fills by +1 when you
  are in a winning battle or when you are killed by a monster.
- Added Ignitions! Ignitions are stronger boosts that you purchase in the shop via black orbs. They consume IgnitionGauge to
  use and to maintain during battle. Each Ignition has its own special effect and augment bonus that happens when you activate
  the ignition.
- Added the /me reverts from (Ignition Name) command.  Use this if you want to turn the Ignition off manually before 
  your IG runs out.
- Added the passive skill: TreasureHunter.  This skill will increase the odds of better colored chests when a chest is generated,
  and the odds of getting a random item at the end of battle if the monsters have one to give. This skill is cumulative with
  everyone who has it but in order to take effect, the players must be alive at the end of battle.
- Added the passive skill: BackGuard.  This skill will decrease the odds of monsters going first in battle. It's cumulative 
  with everyone who has it and is in battle.

  seal that prevents players and monsters from using techniques that battle.

  something random.
- Added the active skill: ThirdEye. This skill, when used, will allow the user to dodge 1-2 attacks.
- Added the active skill: Scavenge. This skill, when used, will allow a player to try to dig something up out of the battlefield's
  ground. The items that are possible in the battlefields are set by the bot owner in battlefields.lst. Players can use this skill
  one time per battle, successfully or not. Each level in this skill increases the odds of finding an item.
- Added the active skill: Just Release. This skill, when used, will convert damage blocked via Royal Guard into an attack on
  a target. The amount of damage done is (skill level)% * blocked damage. After use, the blocked meter will be reset to 0.
  You can see how much you have stored in !stats.
- Added the monster-only skill: Magic Shift. When used, this skill will randomize what element a monster is strong/weak to and 
  healed by.
- Added the monster-only skill: DemonPortal. When used, this skill will allow a monster to create a Demon Portal monster.
  On the portal's turn, it will generate another monster onto the battlefield provided there's less than 5 monsters on the field.
  It will only stop when the portal is dead. Monsters with DemonPortal skill can also heal the portal.
- Added the monster-only skill: MonsterConsume. When used, a monster will eat/kill another monster and gain 40% of its stats

  !clear desc character   or  !clear desc mightystrike 
- Added new achievements
- Added a new item type: IgnitionGauge.  This type will restore some of a player's IgnitionGauge. 
  The "IgnitionStar" is an example item but can only be found in chests.
- Added a new item: DunceCap. This item is crafted only. When used it will attempt to inflict IntDown on a target.
- Added a new item type: Snatch.  This item type will allow the user to attempt to grab a monster and use it as a shield (makes
  the monster cover the user).  The odds of it working depend on the level and speed of both user and target.
- Added a new item: Grappling_Hook, type snatch.
- Added the "bored" status. When inflicted upon a target, the target will miss a few turns.
- Added the "confused" status. When inflicted upon a target, the target will randomly attack opponents including his/her own
  allies.
- Added the "reflect" status. If someone casts a spell on someone who has this status, the spell will bounce back and hit the
  caster. Curing spells ignore the reflect status though if they heal.
- Added the "protect" status. When on, it cuts melee attacks down by half.
- Added the "shell" status. When on, it cuts magic damage down by half.
- Added a new special boss fight: Demon Wall.  In this type the bot will generate a demon wall based on the current 
  battle streak. This boss fight is also timed; darkness will occur in 5 minutes and it's instant death if darkness triggers.
- Added two new battle formulas. Bot Admins can use !toggle Battle Formula to switch between them.  The version 1.0-1.5 formula
  is now gone. Bot Owners can switch it manually in system.dat [system] BattleDamageFormula=1 or 2  By default, 2 is default.
- Added the ability for monsters to be immune to Weapon Lock. Under [Skills] add Resist-Weaponlock=100   Unlike other resists,
  this one is either all or none.  If it's not 100, then weapon lock will always work.
- Added the ability for monsters and NPCs (not shadow clones) to use ignitions. In order for a monster/npc to use an ignition
  they must have 100+ IgnitionGauge under the [battle] section AND must have a valid ignition in [ignitions] (ignitionName=1)
  Like other techs, it's a random chance that they will use it.
- Added the ability for players to take the monsters by surprise and go first in battle at random.
- Added battlefield events! At random, various things may happen at the end of a turn now including healing, damaging or
  inflicting a status on either everyone, all players, all monsters, or just a random person. Bot owners can disable this
  in system.dat under [system] EnableBattlefieldEvents=  and bot admins can use !toggle battlefield events
- Added armor! Basic armor can be found in chests, middle grade armor can be crafted and higher level armor can be found via
  bosses. To wear armor use: !wear armor name  to remove: !remove armor name. 
- Added Portal Items. These items, when used, will wipe out the current battle and teleport all players to a special battlefield
  to face a difficult boss. Winning or losing these battles doesn't affect the current battle streak.
- Added portal items to the shop. use !shop list portal and !shop buy portal (item) (amount).  Portal items are not bought with
  red orbs, but rather via BeastmenSeals and KindredSeals.
- Added the ability for regular monsters to drop items to the most stylish person. It's a 30% chance, if a monster in the
  battle has a drops=item in their [info] section.
- Added a random chance that a double turn will occur without Sugitekai.
- Added Allied Notes. You can see your own allied notes with: !allied notes  and other people with !allied notes Person
  As of right now, the allied notes aren't used for anything..but soon.
- Added the ability for battles to end in a draw if all the monsters and players are dead at the same time.
- Added the ability for bot admins to enable a Double Currency Event.  While this event is on, red orbs will be doubled.  
  Bot admins can enable and disable it using !toggle bonus event 
- Added the ability for monsters and npcs to use bloodpact. However, their summon has to be set manually and it's a good idea
  to set a description (else it will be displayed wrong).  To set the summon in [Skills] put Summon=name  The name must be a
  summon that exists in the \summons\ folder.  To set the description: [descriptions] bloodpact=desc here
  Look at the Yagudo_Summoner monster for an example.
- Added a new style: CounterStance.  This style will enhance the odds of countering melee attacks done against you. Higher levels
  obviously increases the odds. This style also gives access to the !perfect counter skill that can be used one time per battle
  to ensure one 100% melee counter.
- Added the ability for melee attacks to be countered. When this happens, the person who attacks will end up taking damage.
- Added an !achievements command so you can see which achievements you have unlocked. Can also use it to check other people:
  !achievements person
- Added a !clear achievement command for bot admins. It's !clear achievement person nameofachievement  
- Added a new command: !total deaths person   This command will show how many times a monster/boss/player has been defeated
  in battle.  Unfortunately, it only starts counting bosses and monsters after this update has been applied, so it won't show 
  you how many times those have been beaten prior to this update. Players it will, though, as that's been in the bot for a while.
- Added a new command: !deathboard <monster/boss>  It basically generates a scoreboard based on the monster's or boss' total
  deaths.
- Added the ability for techs and weapons to inflict a status type upon its user. Right now it's a 100% chance. To add it, 
  add SelfStatus=statustype in the tech/weapon.
- Added the ability for monsters to attempt to grab players and use them as shields if they have snatch=1 set in their [skills]
- Added the ability for monsters to have "natural armor" -- Think of it as a shield that has to be broken before the monsters 
  can take damage. Look at the boss Cerberus to see how it's done.
- Added the ability for targets to be completely immune to elemental damage. In [Element] put null=element.element.element
- Added the ability for weapons and techniques to ignore some or all of a target's defense. In techniques.db and weapons.db
  under the name of the tech/weapon, put IgnoreDefense= and the value can be 0 to 100  0 means none, 100 means 100% 
  of def is ignored. 
- Added an IgnoreDrain=true/false flag for monsters, bosses and npcs. When set to true, stuff like Drain Samba and techs
  that normally give back some of the damage in HP won't activate on the target.
- Added the ability for techniques to have multiple hits (like weapons). Use hits= in the [tech] name in techniques.db.
  Unlike weapons, techniques can go up to 8 total hits.
- Added the Biome option to monsters.  In [info] you can put Biome=  and the list has to be valid battlefield types or
  left blank.  If set, the monster will only have a chance to show up if the battlefield matches one of the biomes in the
  list.  You can set multiples like so: Biome=river.beach.desert
- Added the spells Protect and Shell to almost every wand/staff. These spells will bestow the buff Protect or Shell upon
  the target. 
- Added the ability for monsters to drop green, white and orange orbs upon dying. These small temporary orbs will restore
  some hp, tp or ignition gauge to the person who kills the monster. Note that using AOEs to kill the monsters will result
  in no orbs being dropped. They only drop on melee and single-target techs.
- Changed the zombie regen to scale a bit better so that lower streaks won't have 100+ hp regenerated.
- Changed the way red orbs are rewarded so that lower streaks have a much lower max orbs and higher streaks can actually give
  more than 100%. 
- Changed the key and chest drop rates.
- Changed the shop so that there's a cap on the old-style boosts. Players can now only own 500 levels into them.
- Changed the "First round protection" code so that it should also protect players from being one-shotted on monsters from a
  new wave.
- Changed the way the bot does the status effects to try and make it show them in the channel better and to block players from
  being able to control their actions until all of the status effects have been displayed (to prevent various bugs).
- Changed the damage amount that magic special effects (burning, drowning, shocked, etc) do to targets. It's now increased to
  5% of maximum HP of the target.
- Changed the Melee-Only type battles so that they no longer appear during boss battles.
- Changed the way status effects work so that multiple status effects may be used at a time on techs/weapons/items. Just
  be sure to add them like this: status.status.status  (note the . inbetween the status effects)
- Changed AOEs so that if the person who initiated the AOE dies at any point during the AOE, the AOE itself will stop cold.
- Changed the bot so that seasonal monsters don't need to be copied manually over. In order for the bot to load them during the
  correct month, set this: streak=-1000  and month=01 or month=02 or month=03, etc under [info].  See Robot_Santa or
  Gobbles for an example.
- Changed Quicksilver so that it can't be used multiple times in a row. There has to be at least 1 turn between uses.
- Changed the way the bot gets the items inside the chests. Now bot owners have more control over it. See chests.lst for the
  lists and the ability to edit them.
- Changed !items so that the keys are no longer listed there. Use !keys to see the keys you have.
- Changed the Final Getsuga type boost so that while it's on EVERY AUGMENT will be on at the same time.
- Changed the !items code so that it clears out items that the player has 0 of in their files.
- Changed the curse night and melee-only events so that they won't occur below streak 50.
- Changed the orb reward code so that people who flee from battle will not receive the OrbHunter or Accessory orb bonuses.
- Changed the clear_battle alias code a little to try and make it slightly faster and better at clearing out monsters/npcs and
  bad files
- Changed the !scoreboard command to show a varying amount of top players depending on how many players are in the game. It will
  now show the top 3, the top 5, or the top 10.
- Changed !status and the turn status line to show some of the skills active on the person.
- Changed many of the basic character commands (such as !hp, !tp, !items, !skills, etc) to work in private message as well
  as the channel. Now if you use those commands in a private message, the message will be displayed privately to you. If you
  use them in the channel, it will be as it was before and show the message in the channel.
- Fixed a bug in which selling a technique might result in 0 orbs back.
- Fixed a bug in which cover would activate when a monster used taunt on a covered target.
- Fixed an issue where setting a high difficulty would still result in low level monsters on lower streaks. Now it summons the
  correct level monsters.
- Fixed an issue with magic effect deaths in which they wouldn't check for the revive status or for the spawn after death function
- Fixed a bug with chests that gave orbs. It would write a red=orbs orbs orbs line or black=orbs orbs orbs line in the 
  player's item_amount section.  That should be fixed now.
- Fixed a bug with the GIVE command in which a misspelled name would cause an error that would stop the bot in its tracks.
- Fixed a bug with the GIVE command in which giving more than one item would cause the receiver to only receive 1 of the item
  and the rest would be lost.
- Fixed a bug in which players could exploit the bot using descriptions.
