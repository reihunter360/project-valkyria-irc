This is just my thanks for all those who have helped me make this bot!  



Scott "Smz" of Esper.net
He helped me with a bunch of ideas.  Not only that, he was the first BETA tester of version 1.0; Without him, I don't think I could have done this.

Andrio of Esper.net 
Helped me test out the bot and found a few glitches that needed to be fixed.

Caught a major bug with the passwords which made changing your password from the default impossible.

Raiden of Esper.net
He helped test the bot and found a bot-breaking bug in which certain encoded passwords wouldn't work with the !id and !quick id commands.

Discovered a huge bug with !new char that let players use the command over and over to get free orbs.
