==============================================================
The weather is now controlled via this file rather than
weather.lst.  It works the same though.  Boost= how much 
the correct weather will boost a magic spell.
==============================================================

[weather]
current=calm
list=calm.bright.gloomy.rainy.stormy.snowy.windy.hot.dry
boost=.25


==============================================================
Battlefields are where the players face the monsters.
The battlefields themselves control the weather and
may have events that occasionally happen. There
can be more than one event set per battlefield. 

Please look at the pre-existing events for 
how to set it all up.

Valid Targets: all, random, monsters, players
 * note that "players" as a target also affects NPCs

Valid Event Types: damage, heal, statusonly

Valid Limitations: no-tech, no-item, no-skill, no-ignition

** If you make a new battlefield and want the bot to be able
to select it for battles, make sure you put the name of it
into battlefields.lst
