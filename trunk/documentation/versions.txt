1.3
- Added the "translation.dat" file that contains most of the bot messages.  You can edit this file to do translations or
  to just change the way various messages read. Open it in notepad.
- Added the active skill "Analysis".  This skill lets you analyze a monster.  Increased levels of the skill gives you more
  information about the monster.  To use it, after purchasing it, use !analyze monstername  You can only analyze monsters
  that are in the current battle.

- Added the passive skill "Haggling" -- This skill will increase the amount of orbs you get for selling items by 20*skill level
  EXCEPT in cases where the amount you'd get from haggling is more than the actual cost of the item (i.e. a potion).  
  In that case you just get the original item price back, or up to 500 orbs back if it goes over 500.
- Added the passive skill "WeaponBash" -- This skill will give a chance of inflicting the 'stun' status effect to a target
  with each melee hit. Note, if the target is immune to stun it will never take effect.

  "DiscountCard" has been added as an example item. 250,000 orbs and will lower it by 10 points.
- Added a new item type: Revive with a GoldOrb as an example item.  If you use the item on someone (or yourself) in battle
  they will receive the "revive" status.  If that person dies in the same battle, they will be revived automatically 
  with 1/2 max hp.

  0-5 damage max if the person using them isn't a monster or a NPC.
- Added the ability for techs to change which base stat is used for damage. You can add a stat= with the stat you want
  to use in the tech file.  For example:  stat=str  or stat=spd     By default it's int.
- Added the Heal-AOE type. This type will heal all allies on the battlefield. This tech type can't be used on enemies.
- Added the ability to sell items back to the shop. Use !shop sell item (item name) (amount) to sell them back.
- Added the ability for monsters/bosses to be "staggered" -- if they sustain enough damage they'll collapse and will 
  be unable to move for a round.  They can only be staggered once per battle. In the [info] section of a monster/boss you can
  add CanStagger=yes  then add StaggerAmount=$rand(#,#)   where # is the amount of hp you want the range to be. Stagger will
  activate when damage exceeds the random amount picked from the range.
- Added the Quicksilver style. This still allows players to use the !quicksilver command that will freeze everyone except the
  user in time. Players can use the !quicksilver command in battle as many times as style's level. The effect basically gives
  players a free Sugitekai.
- Added the ability for monsters to ignore the darkness/rage mode system.  In [info] you can put RageMode=ignore  if you 
  want them to not get the darkness/rage mode bonus.

  from automatically taking effect.

- Added accessories to the bot! Once you get one you can use !wear (accessory name) to put it on and 
  !remove (accessory name) if you want to remove it.
- Added two AI types for monsters. They are: Defender and Berserker.  Defender type monsters won't attack at all during 
  battle and Berserker type monsters may attack their own allies at random. You can change it  in [info] ai_type=         
  Leave it blank if you want monsters to act as normal.
- Added the beginning of an achievement system.
- Added the max shop level in the system.dat.  Bot owners can now change it to whatever they want. By default it's 25.
- Added a new boss type fight: Doppelganger.  It's a rare, 5% chance, event that instead of summoning a normal boss, players
  will have to fight evil copies of themselves. Bot owners can disable it in the system.dat by setting EnableDoppenganger 
  to false.
- Added new monsters
- Added new bosses

- Changed the prices of several skills/weapon upgrades/techs/items.

  hundreds of thousands of hp one-shotting every monster/boss in the game.
- Changed the maximum number of times a target can be successfully stolen from to 2.
- Changed the maximum amount of HP you can buy from the shop. The default is 2500.  After you hit the max you won't be able
  to get any more. Bot owners can change the max in the system.dat.
- Changed the maximum amount of TP you can buy from the shop. The default is 500.  After you hit the max you won't be able
  to get any more. Bot owners can change the max in the system.dat.
- Changed the maximum amount of style points you can accumulate in one battle to 5000.
- Changed the location of the skill cooldown times into the skills.db. Bot Owners can now edit that file to edit skill reuse times
- Changed the way boss drops works so that they can have multiple drops. The bot will still only pick one drop, but now you can
  make it random.
- Changed it so if multiple bosses enter the battle, all of their drops should be in the pool rather than just the
  most recent boss to join.
- Changed the damage formula on poison.  Instead of doing random 5-10 damage a turn (which is nothing when players 
  have HP over 1000), it now does a percentage of a target's max HP.  The "Heavily Poisoned" status does even more than 
  normal poison.
- Changed the next turn timer so that it's only 3 minutes instead of 5.
- Changed the damage formula slightly for 4 hit and 5 hit attacks.
- Changed the code so that boss battles may spawn normal monsters as well when the winning streak is greater than 50.

  by 25% (plus a random 1-5% at random) each level.
- Changed OrbHunter so that bot owners can place the amount they want the skill to increase orbs by.  In skills.db you can put in
  Amount=  under [OrbHunter].  Default is now 15*skill level.

- Fixed a bug in which the zombie regeneration wasn't wearing off at the end of battle.
- Fixed a bug with the Amnesia status type.
- Fixed a bug with !rdesc
- Fixed a bug in which the "Swordmaster" skill wasn't giving any bonus to the melee damage.
- Fixed a bug with Steal in which stolen items weren't being added right
- Fixed a bug in which the description wasn't being shown properly for +TP items.
- Fixed the bot so that it will correctly give the right access level to the entire bot owner list when the bot is first turned on.
- Fixed a bug in which occasionally the style level wasn't leveling properly.  Sometimes it would jump by +2 or +3, other times
  it would be reset to level 1. 
- Fixed a bug that was letting players purchase monster weapons.
- Fixed a bug in which fleeing would cause the bot to break in a one vs one battle against an orb fountain.
- Fixed a bug in which you could use consumable items with the !use command and the item would be decreased from your inventory.
- Fixed a bug in which MightyStrike could be used continuously without a cooldown.
- Fixed a bug where if something was weak to lightning it would also take double damage for light element as well.
- Fixed a bug with Fullbring when used on +TP items.

- Added the passive skill Vogue.  This skill will increase the amount of style XP you get at the end of a battle by your
  current skill level.

  level that you have in the skill, up to 100% of your str.  Afterwards it will reduce your str down to 5.
- Added the passive skill Archery. This skill will increase damage done with a bow.
- Changed the way the utsusemi/royalguard/manawall blocked messages are displayed. They're shown after the attack desc now, not
  before it. This actually saves a line being pushed to the channel.
- Changed the way status types are inflicted upon a target. Much cleaner code and now any type of tech or weapon can inflict a 
  status.  Just add a StatusType=(status type) to the weapon/tech.  The Type=Status is now defunct, and it should be set as 
  Single or AOE.
- Changed the way the red orb rewards are listed so that it now shows what each person gets based on his/her skills/accessories
  rather than simply showing just the base amount that everyone gets.
- Changed the formula for how monsters get boosted when generated. 
- Fixed a bug in which AOE Heals were subtracting the target's def from the amount when it shouldn't have.
