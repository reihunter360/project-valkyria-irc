- Added the ability to purchase multiple items from the shop with one command. To do so, just add an amount at the end of the
  command (example:  !shop buy items name #  where # is the amount you want with one purchase.) It doesn't work with styles

1.3
- Added the "translation.dat" file that contains most of the bot messages.  You can edit this file to do translations or
  to just change the way various messages read. Open it in notepad.
- Added the active skill "Analysis".  This skill lets you analyze a monster.  Increased levels of the skill gives you more
  information about the monster.  To use it, after purchasing it, use !analyze monstername  You can only analyze monsters
  that are in the current battle.

- Added the passive skill "Zen" -- this skill will increase the amount of TP you get back per turn by 5*skill level.
- Added the passive skill "Haggling" -- This skill will increase the amount of orbs you get for selling items by 20*skill level
  EXCEPT in cases where the amount you'd get from haggling is more than the actual cost of the item (i.e. a potion).  
  In that case you just get the original item price back, or up to 500 orbs back if it goes over 500.
- Added the passive skill "WeaponBash" -- This skill will give a chance of inflicting the 'stun' status effect to a target
  with each melee hit. Note, if the target is immune to stun it will never take effect.
- Added a new item type: ShopReset. This item type will allow you to lower your current shop level by an amount. The
  "DiscountCard" has been added as an example item. 250,000 orbs and will lower it by 10 points.
- Added a new item type: Revive with a GoldOrb as an example item.  If you use the item on someone (or yourself) in battle
  they will receive the "revive" status.  If that person dies in the same battle, they will be revived automatically 
  with 1/2 max hp.
- Added an anti-cheat system for players using monster weapons/techniques. Attacks/Techs done with monster weapons will be
  0-5 damage max if the person using them isn't a monster or a NPC.
- Added the ability for techs to change which base stat is used for damage. You can add a stat= with the stat you want
  to use in the tech file.  For example:  stat=str  or stat=spd     By default it's int.
- Added the Heal-AOE type. This type will heal all allies on the battlefield. This tech type can't be used on enemies.
- Added the ability to sell items back to the shop. Use !shop sell item (item name) (amount) to sell them back.
- Added the ability for monsters/bosses to be "staggered" -- if they sustain enough damage they'll collapse and will 
  be unable to move for a round.  They can only be staggered once per battle. In the [info] section of a monster/boss you can
  add CanStagger=yes  then add StaggerAmount=$rand(#,#)   where # is the amount of hp you want the range to be. Stagger will
  activate when damage exceeds the random amount picked from the range.
- Added the Quicksilver style. This still allows players to use the !quicksilver command that will freeze everyone except the
  user in time. Players can use the !quicksilver command in battle as many times as style's level. The effect basically gives
  players a free Sugitekai.
- Added the ability for monsters to ignore the darkness/rage mode system.  In [info] you can put RageMode=ignore  if you 
  want them to not get the darkness/rage mode bonus. 
- Added the ability for monsters to be able to absorb certain elements from techniques.  In the [Element] section of the 
  monster bot owners can put Heal= followed by the elements it'll heal with.  For example:  Heal=Fire.Dark

  Note that if a battle is currently in progress it won't take effect until the battle is over.

  from automatically taking effect. 
- Added the ability for monsters to use certain select skills in battle.
- Added accessories to the bot! Once you get one you can use !wear (accessory name) to put it on and 
  !remove (accessory name) if you want to remove it.
- Added two AI types for monsters. They are: Defender and Berserker.  Defender type monsters won't attack at all during 
  battle and Berserker type monsters may attack their own allies at random. You can change it  in [info] ai_type=         
  Leave it blank if you want monsters to act as normal.
- Added the beginning of an achievement system.
- Added the max shop level in the system.dat.  Bot owners can now change it to whatever they want. By default it's 25.
- Added a new boss type fight: Doppelganger.  It's a rare, 5% chance, event that instead of summoning a normal boss, players
  will have to fight evil copies of themselves. Bot owners can disable it in the system.dat by setting EnableDoppenganger 
  to false.
- Added new monsters
- Added new bosses
- Added new summons
- Added new NPCs
- Changed the way the monster/boss/npc lists are generated to hopefully make them more random and to prevent a future bug.
- Changed the prices of several skills/weapon upgrades/techs/items.
- Changed the max amount of damage of suicide techs that can be done by players to 500.  This should prevent someone with
  hundreds of thousands of hp one-shotting every monster/boss in the game.
- Changed the maximum number of times a target can be successfully stolen from to 2.
- Changed the maximum amount of HP you can buy from the shop. The default is 2500.  After you hit the max you won't be able
  to get any more. Bot owners can change the max in the system.dat.
- Changed the maximum amount of TP you can buy from the shop. The default is 500.  After you hit the max you won't be able
  to get any more. Bot owners can change the max in the system.dat.
- Changed the maximum amount of style points you can accumulate in one battle to 5000.
- Changed the location of the skill cooldown times into the skills.db. Bot Owners can now edit that file to edit skill reuse times
- Changed the way boss drops works so that they can have multiple drops. The bot will still only pick one drop, but now you can
  make it random.
- Changed it so if multiple bosses enter the battle, all of their drops should be in the pool rather than just the
  most recent boss to join.
- Changed the damage formula on poison.  Instead of doing random 5-10 damage a turn (which is nothing when players 
  have HP over 1000), it now does a percentage of a target's max HP.  The "Heavily Poisoned" status does even more than 
  normal poison.
- Changed the next turn timer so that it's only 3 minutes instead of 5.
- Changed the damage formula slightly for 4 hit and 5 hit attacks.
- Changed the code so that boss battles may spawn normal monsters as well when the winning streak is greater than 50.
- Changed the BloodPact skill so that it goes up to level 10. Higher levels of the skill will increase the stats of the summon
  by 25% (plus a random 1-5% at random) each level.
- Changed OrbHunter so that bot owners can place the amount they want the skill to increase orbs by.  In skills.db you can put in
  Amount=  under [OrbHunter].  Default is now 15*skill level.

- Fixed a bug in which the description wasn't being shown properly for +TP items.
- Fixed the bot so that it will correctly give the right access level to the entire bot owner list when the bot is first turned on.
- Fixed a bug in which occasionally the style level wasn't leveling properly.  Sometimes it would jump by +2 or +3, other times
  it would be reset to level 1. 
- Fixed a bug that was letting players purchase monster weapons.
- Fixed a bug in which fleeing would cause the bot to break in a one vs one battle against an orb fountain.
- Fixed a bug in which you could use consumable items with the !use command and the item would be decreased from your inventory.
- Fixed a bug in which MightyStrike could be used continuously without a cooldown.
- Fixed a bug where if something was weak to lightning it would also take double damage for light element as well.
- Fixed a bug with Fullbring when used on +TP items.
- Fixed a bug in which monsters killed by AOEs were giving double the style points that it should have.

  Chests can only be unlocked with the correct colored key. Chests will disappear after 45 seconds. 
- Added a way to save and restore winning streaks. Think of it sort of like a quick save in RPGs. The commands are:
  !save battle streak to save the streak, !reload battle streak  to reload, and !view battle save  to see what's saved.
  Note: You can't save a streak that's lower than your previous save, you can't reload during a positive winning streak, and 
  once you load the current save you have will be reset.
- Added keys. Keys are dropped by monsters randomly after the 15th win on the winning streak. The person who gets the key is
  random, but the person has to be alive at the end of battle to be considered. To use the key just use !use KeyName on Chest

  more time.

- Added new monsters
- Added new bosses
- Changed the way the utsusemi/royalguard/manawall blocked messages are displayed. They're shown after the attack desc now, not
  before it. This actually saves a line being pushed to the channel.
- Changed the way status types are inflicted upon a target. Much cleaner code and now any type of tech or weapon can inflict a 
  status.  Just add a StatusType=(status type) to the weapon/tech.  The Type=Status is now defunct, and it should be set as 
  Single or AOE.
- Changed the way the red orb rewards are listed so that it now shows what each person gets based on his/her skills/accessories
  rather than simply showing just the base amount that everyone gets.

1.5 
- Added a check so that people can only create a certain # of characters max. This only works if the bot can look up 
  IP addresses and people have logged into their characters with this feature on (so that it stores the IPs).  
  The max # of chars allowed is in system.dat and can be changed to the bot owner's liking.
- Added the ability for monsters and clones to change their weapons in the middle of battle before attacking.
  Neither can change to glyphs if they aren't already equipped when the clone/doppelganger is created. Note that regular
  monsters and bosses have a higher rate of changing their weapons vs both types of doppelgangers.
- Added the active skill Provoke -- Will cause a monster you use it on to attack you its next round instead of another target.
- Added the active skill Disarm -- Will attempt to disarm a target back to their base fists. 
- Added the active skill "WeaponLock" -- Will consume Sokubaku to lock a target's weapon in place for a # of turns.
- Added the resistance skill "Resist-Petrify"  -- right now it only goes to 20.  Like other resists, 
  it decreases the chance that petrify will work on you.

  only the Vampire_Killer whip is set to true.

  The max is 10% (level 10 Trickster).
- Added the command !battle hp -- This command can only be used in battle and will display the HP status of all allies. 
- Added the !scoreboard command. This command can only be used when there's 3 or more players in the game. It will rank the
  top 3 players based on a number of factors (including stats, orbs, chests opened, etc).
- Added the !score command. This command will show players their individual scores.
- Added a new flag in system.dat that bot owners can toggle manually.  It's called ShowOrbsCmdInChannel=true/false   
  If true, the !orbs command will display the person's orb total in channel.  If set false, it will send it to the person 
  in a private message. 
- Added a bonus effect to using a weapon that a user has a mastery maxed in: Parrying. If a player's mastery for the 
  weapon equipped is 100 or greater, there's a small chance that the person will parry a melee attack using that weapon.
  Using the style Weapon Master will help the odds of parrying an attack, but a person still needs 100 mastery first.
- Added a notification to the player style leveling up so players know when their style levels.
- Added the ability for multiple waves of monsters. The higher the winning streak, the bigger the chance that there will be
  more than one wave of monsters to arrive. Battles with multiple waves will have a higher max orb reward limit.

  current difficulty level and !save difficulty #  to set it. The # can be 0 or any number greater than 0.

- Changed the code to try and reduce the odds of monsters one-shotting players on turn #1. 
- Changed !stats so that you can now use it on other players to see what their stats are.  It cannot be used on NPCs

  up the other person.
- Changed it so bosses will no longer appear below streak #10.
- Changed /me gives so that you don't HAVE to specify a number if you only want to give 1 of an item.

- Fixed a major security flaw.
- Fixed a bug in which DARK type spells weren't being enhanced by GLOOMY type weather.
- Fixed a bug in which the WIZARDRY passive skill wasn't working right due to a mispelling. There's a temporary fix in the bot
  that will be removed in 1.6. Have one battle end before characters buy any more into the wizardry skill to fix it.
- Fixed a bug with the Aztec-GoldCoin accessory and gave its absorb effect a bit of a boost.
- Fixed a bug in which it was possible to cover a non-existent character, thus causing errors that would freeze the bot.
- Fixed a bug with AOEs being used on players in PVP in which it would hit the user and miss some other players.

2.0
- Added the Augment system. Use the command !augment by itself to see the augments you have equipped. To add augments to a 
  weapon use: !augment add (weapon) (rune)  To remove an augment: !augment remove (weapon)
- Added "Runes" to the items list. Runes are used to augment weapons with special effects. Use !runes to see which runes you own.
- Added boss drops to evil doppelgangers and warmachines. The drops will be random based on various items in items.db.
- Added silver chests and silver keys.
- Added Renkei (Skillchains). If two techniques that qualify (non-magic) are done to a target, it will activate a renkei that
  will deal additional damage to a target.
- Added a new stat: Ignition Gauge.  You can see your current ignition gauge by using !ig or !ignition gauge.  You can buy it
  in the shop with !buy stats IG #  Unlike hp/tp, buying them won't full the gauge to full.
- Added the passive skill: TreasureHunter.  This skill will increase the odds of better colored chests when a chest is generated. 
  It's cumulative with everyone who has it but in order to take effect, the players must be alive at the end of battle.
- Added the active skill: Konzen-Ittai. This skill, when activated, will allow you to perform a self-Renkei with a non-magic, 
  non-AOE, technique.
- Changed the zombie regen to scale a bit better so that lower streaks won't have 100+ hp regenerated.
- Changed the way red orbs are rewarded so that lower streaks have a much lower max orbs and higher streaks can actually give
  more than 100%. 
- Changed the key and chest drop rates.
- Changed the shop so that there's a cap on the old-style boosts. Players can now only own 500 levels into them.
- Changed the "First round protection" code so that it should also protect players from being one-shotted on monsters from a
  new wave.
- Fixed a bug in which selling a technique might result in 0 orbs back.
- Fixed a bug in which cover would activate when a monster used taunt on a covered target.
- Fixed an issue where setting a high difficulty would still result in low level monsters on lower streaks. Now it summons the
  correct level monsters.
