PORTAL BATTLES
Portal Battles are special battles that can only be accessed by first obtaining a special item (usually obtained by trading BeastmenSeal and KindredSeals) and then using that item in battle.  When used, the battlefield will be cleared of all monsters and all players will be teleported to a special battlefield to fight one or more special bosses.

This text file is meant to give more information on all the various battles that can be encountered.
